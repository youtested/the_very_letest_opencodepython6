Flow per turn:
  1. build messages (system + trimmed history + latest user turn + agent reminder)
  2. stream model -> emit text/reasoning/tool_call events to on_event
  3. if tool calls: permission check -> run tool -> append tool result; loop again
  4. cap iterations (safety) and honor interrupt
